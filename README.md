3. What is the average revenue per year?
4. What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
5. Which genres are most popular from year to year?

## The conclusions reached
This data set contains information about 10,866 movies. Data cleaning like removing extraneous columns, deleting null values and deleting duplicates were performed in order to enable accurate analysis. Exploratory data analysis was also carried out to arrive at the following findings:

### Findings

1. The vote average for the movies is 6.16. This indicates the average users' ratings for all the movies.
2. The number of movies produced and the revenue generated have been increasing over time. The highest number of movies were produced in 2011 while the highest revenue was generated in 2015.
3. Movies' Popularity seems to be more positively correlated with revenue. Movies with more popularity seems to generate higher revenue. More research needs to be done on the most important properties associated with high revenue.
4. The top five genres are Drama, Comedy, Thriller, action and adventure.

### Limitations
Nonetheless, these findings must be interpreted with caution and a number of limitations should be borne in mind:

The findings were made based on descriptive statistics.
Additional research need to be peformed to understand why some movies generated zero revenue because the removal of the rows with zero revenue reduced the data shape.
